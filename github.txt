We have 2 big branch call master (to hold test feature for test site) and production

1. When we are creating new feature , what branch should we based on and why ?

 - We should use the master branch because if we create new feature
we have to test, fix bug from the feature clearly first then we merge to production

2. If we have a feature branch that haven't been merged to production and that branch have  bug, what course of action are you going to do with Git to before resolving the bug?

 - git checkout "branch's name" to fix the bug on that branch

3. If someone accidentally merge a feature (feature/delete-user) onto production and have a list of commitId ended with (0492978, fc9348c, k101100), then another commit (a1fsas8) is added on top of the production branch. How do we remove that merged feature? 

 - git log --oneline : to see merge commit id
 - git revert <commit id> -m 1
